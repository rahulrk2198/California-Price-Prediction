# California-Price-Prediction

The project aims to predict median house prices in the California state of USA. It explores the various transformations applied to input data for cleaning and prepare for Machine Learning Algorithms.

This version currently has only considered machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Advanced Techniques like Neural Networks will be explored in the future.
